The value k it's the number of cases to compare. Since the cases to 
test are chosen randomly between 2 and n, the fewer number of cases to 
compare, the higher the probability to "fool" primeTestsF with a 
coprime. The higher number of cases to number, the lower is the 
probability to "fool" primeTestsF with a coprime.
