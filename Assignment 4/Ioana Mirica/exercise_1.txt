The Haskell Road -> Chapter 4 - Sets, Types and Lists
-----------------------------------------------------

1. The Russell Paradox -> how does this work...? (the explanation was confusing)
2. funny x | halts x x = undefined     -- Caution: this
		   | otherwise = True          -- will not work
How is it decided on which branch will it go?
3. Exercise 4.8 Explain the following error message:
	Prelude> elem 1 1
	ERROR: [a] is not an instance of class "Num"
Because the number is checked over a list of numbers (and the second 1 is a number itself, not a list)?
4. Remark. pag 134 -> Everything is a mamber of what? (I don't get it)
